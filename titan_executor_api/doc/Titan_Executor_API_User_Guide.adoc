== Overview

The Titan Executor API provides the following functionalities:

* execution control as in mctr_gui
* callback for host controller connecting events
* console log callback

It is implemented in Java using JNI calls to the C++ side, which is based on the implementation of titan_eclipse JNI executor. The Titan Executor API is independent from Eclipse.

== Prerequisites

* TITAN installed (_libmctrjninative.so_ library file is in _TTCN3_DIR/lib_, and library path is in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
* Java JRE 1.7 installed

== Install

Copy _lib/TITAN_Executor_API.jar_ to your classpath.

== Usage

The entry point of the API is the `com.ericsson.titan.executor.api.JniExecutor`, and the client must implement `com.ericsson.titan.executor.api.IJniExecutorObserver` interface for the callbacks.

For further details see the Javadoc embedded in the project.

== Titan Executor API Demo

=== Install

Copy _TITAN_Executor_API_Demo.jar_ and _lib/TITAN_Executor_API.jar_ to any selected directory, so keep the directory structure, make sure, that _TITAN_Executor_API.jar_ is in _lib/_, so it means, that Titan Executor API is in the classpath, which is defined in the manifest file of _TITAN_Executor_API_Demo.jar_.

=== Usage

To start the demo the following command must be used:

[source]
java -jar <install directory>/TITAN_Executor_API_Demo.jar

== Javadoc

=== Install

Extract javadoc directory from the zip file

=== Usage

Open _javadoc/index.html_ from a browser.
