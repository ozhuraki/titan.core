= About the Document

== Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide detailed information on using the TITAN toolset, that is, creating test suites from TTCN-3, ASN.1 modules, and test port files, by modifying a `Makefile` and using `make` to build executables.

== Target Groups

This document is intended for users of the TITAN TTCNâ€“3 Test Toolset. In addition to this document, readers requiring additional information on creating and building test suites or writing test ports are referred to the link:https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/titan/titan.core/tree/master/usrguide/referenceguide[TITAN Programmer's Technical Reference for TITAN TTCN-3 Test Executor].

NOTE: Test port writing requires a sound knowledge of {cpp} programming.
